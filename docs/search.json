    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nWater can serve as a hydrogen source because it contains chemically bound hydrogen atoms (H₂O → H₂ + ½ O₂) that can be released through catalytic reactions such as water splitting, reforming, or hydrogen transfer. At the same time, water can act as a reaction medium because it is abundant, non-toxic, inexpensive, and able to dissolve or disperse reactants, often enabling environmentally friendly reaction conditions. This dual functionality allows researchers to develop novel catalytic materials and processes that integrate hydrogen generation with chemical transformations, supporting sustainable energy conversion by reducing fossil-fuel reliance and minimizing environmental impact."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThis study investigates catalytic reaction systems that utilize biomass as a renewable feedstock for producing fuels and value-added chemicals. Biomass, derived from agricultural residues, forestry by-products, algae, and organic waste, is abundant, carbon-neutral in principle, and widely distributed, offering a sustainable alternative to fossil resources. Efficient catalytic conversion of biomass enables the production of high–energy-density fuels, such as bioethanol, biodiesel, and sustainable aviation fuel, as well as platform chemicals for polymers and specialty materials. Beyond energy and chemical production, biomass valorization mitigates environmental pollution from organic waste streams, supports a circular bioeconomy, and enhances rural economic development by creating local value chains. However, the chemical complexity of biomass necessitates advanced catalytic materials and reaction systems, combined with mechanistic and kinetic understanding, to achieve high selectivity, conversion efficiency, and scalability. By integrating innovative catalysts with optimized reaction strategies, this work aims to demonstrate a sustainable approach to biomass upgrading, contributing directly to renewable energy deployment, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and the transition toward a low-carbon economy."

    "text": "Abstract\nTransforming polyolefin waste into liquid alkanes through tandem cracking-alkylation reactions catalyzed by Lewis-acid chlorides offers an efficient route for single-step plastic upcycling. Lewis acids in dichloromethane establish a polar environment that stabilizes carbenium ion intermediates and catalyzes hydride transfer, enabling breaking of polyethylene C−C bonds and forming C−C bonds in alkylation. Here, we show that efficient and selective deconstruction of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to liquid alkanes is achieved with anhydrous aluminum chloride (AlCl3) and gallium chloride (GaCl3). Already at 60 °C, complete LDPE conversion was achieved, while maintaining the selectivity for gasoline-range liquid alkanes over 70%. AlCl3 showed an exceptional conversion rate of 5000 g_LDPE 〖 mol〗_cat^(-1) 〖 h〗^(-1), surpassing other Lewis acid catalysts by two orders of magnitude. Through kinetic and mechanistic studies, we show that the rates of LDPE conversion do not correlate directly with the intrinsic strength of the Lewis acids or steric constraints that may limit the polymer to access the Lewis acid sites. Instead, the rates for the tandem processes of cracking and alkylation are primarily governed by the rates of initiation of carbenium ions and the subsequent intermolecular hydride transfer. Both jointly control the relative rates of cracking and alkylation, thereby determining the overall conversion and selectivity."

Upcycling polyolefins poses significant challenges due to their inherent kinetic and thermodynamic stability. Traditional methods, such as thermal and catalytic cracking, are straightforward but require temperatures exceeding 400 °C for complete conversion because of thermodynamic constraints. The objective of the our work is to provide fundamental insights into low-temperature elementary reactions that can be used to couple C-C bond cleavage in polyolefins with exothermic scav-enging of the fragments formed in a single-stage process and to identify model reactants that can be used to accurately describe the location and rates of C-C cleavage events in polyolefin feedstocks."

    "text": "Abstract\nChloroaluminate ionic liquids selectively transform (waste) polyolefins into gasoline-range alkanes through tandem cracking-alkylation at temperatures below 100°C. Further improvement of this process necessitates a deep understanding of the nature of the catalytically active species and the correlated performance in the catalyzing critical reactions for the tandem polyolefin deconstruction with isoalkanes at low temperatures. Here, we address this requirement by determining the nuclearity of the chloroaluminate ions and their interactions with reaction intermediates, combining in situ 27Al magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, Al K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy, and catalytic activity measurement. Cracking and alkylation are facilitated by carbenium ions initiated by AlCl3-tert-butyl chloride (TBC) adducts, which are formed by the dissociation of Al2Cl7− in the presence of TBC. The carbenium ions activate the alkane polymer strands and advance the alkylation cycle through multiple hydride transfer reactions. In situ 1H NMR and operando infrared spectroscopy demonstrate that the cracking and alkylation processes occur synchronously; alkenes formed during cracking are rapidly incorporated into the carbenium ion-mediated alkylation cycle. The conclusions are further supported by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations coupled with an enhanced sampling method, and model experiments using n-hexadecane as a feed."

    "text": "Overview\nThe urgent global demand to mitigate climate change and transition to a sustainable energy future has intensified interest in technologies capable of efficiently converting C₁ molecules—such as carbon dioxide (CO₂) and carbon monoxide (CO)—into high–energy-density carriers, including fuels and value-added chemicals. These molecules are abundant, inexpensive, and in the case of CO₂, a primary greenhouse gas. Transforming them into usable forms of energy not only provides an alternative to fossil fuels but also offers a pathway for carbon recycling, thereby reducing net greenhouse gas emissions. However, C₁ molecules are chemically stable and kinetically inert, requiring highly active and selective catalysts to drive their conversion under practical conditions. Developing catalytic materials with both high efficiency and long-term stability is therefore critical to achieving meaningful industrial application. Efficiency ensures that the process operates with minimal energy input and high product yields, while stability guarantees that catalysts maintain their performance over extended operation, reducing costs associated with frequent regeneration or replacement. Furthermore, the rational design of such catalysts cannot rely solely on empirical approaches; it demands in-depth mechanistic and kinetic studies to uncover the fundamental reaction pathways, rate-determining steps, and deactivation mechanisms. These insights allow researchers to tailor the active sites, electronic structures, and microenvironments of catalysts to optimize performance and selectivity. Understanding kinetics also enables precise control over reaction conditions, minimizing side reactions and improving process economics. Beyond the laboratory scale, these studies inform the scaling-up of processes by providing accurate models for reactor design and operation. In the broader context of low-carbon energy technologies, the integration of advanced catalytic systems into renewable-powered chemical manufacturing could enable the production of liquid fuels, synthetic natural gas, and other high-energy-density carriers from captured CO₂ or syngas derived from biomass, waste, or renewable electricity–driven electrolysis. Such carriers are essential for sectors where direct electrification is challenging, including aviation, shipping, and certain industrial processes. Moreover, the capability to store renewable energy in chemical form helps address intermittency issues associated with wind and solar power, improving grid stability and energy security. In summary, the strategic development of efficient, durable catalytic materials—guided by rigorous mechanistic and kinetic understanding—is indispensable for overcoming the inherent chemical inertness of C₁ molecules and for enabling their economically viable conversion into high-value products. This approach not only advances the frontier of catalysis research but also serves as a cornerstone technology for achieving global decarbonization goals, fostering a circular carbon economy, and ensuring a resilient, low-carbon energy infrastructure."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nPolyolefin waste is the largest polymer waste stream that could potentially serve as an advantageous hydrocarbon feedstock. Upcycling polyolefins poses significant challenges due to their inherent kinetic and thermodynamic stability. Traditional methods, such as thermal and catalytic cracking, are straightforward but require temperatures exceeding 400 °C for complete conversion because of thermodynamic constraints. The objective of the our work is to provide fundamental insights into low-temperature elementary reactions that can be used to couple C-C bond cleavage in polyolefins with exothermic scav-enging of the fragments formed in a single-stage process and to identify model reactants that can be used to accurately describe the location and rates of C-C cleavage events in polyolefin feedstocks."
